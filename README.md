Softuni Wiki


<h2>Application Overview</h2>
Get familiar with the provided HTML & CSS and create an application that allows users to create and read encyclopedia articles. An anonymous user should be able to access the home page and view any article, as well as register/login. A registered user can edit any article. Your application should also have administrators.  Admins can lock and delete articles. Locked articles can’t be edited by non-admins.
Since anyone can edit any article, it’s important that edit history is stored for each article and previous versions can be accessed in their entirety. Design your models in such a way as to allow for multiple older versions of an article to exist and be viewable.

<h2>Application Deploy</h2>

<h2>Home Page & Navigation</h2> 
The home page should display all navigation menus, an excerpt of the latest article (first 50 words of the content) and links to the three most recently added articles. Registered users see a greeting with option to log out, while anonymous users have the option to login or register (see provided HTML).
Make sure only the necessary elements are displayed in the navigation menu and on every page, depending on the status of the user (anonymous, logged in, admin).
 
 
 
<h2>Create Article </h2>
For authenticated users
An article must have a title, a locked status and a list of edits. Each edit has an author, a creation date, content, and an associated article. Upon creation of the article, its title is stored, the locked status is set to false and the contents, which the user has entered, are stored in an edit, associated with that article. The user becomes the author for the edit and the creation date is set to the current time.
